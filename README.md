Cryptocurrency Analysis

## Overview

This project aims to analyze the performance of cryptocurrencies during different periods, such as the COVID-19 pandemic and the Ukraine War. It includes data collection, analysis of daily returns, correlation analysis, risk-adjusted performance evaluation, and visualization of the findings.

## Data Collection

- Historical daily price data for cryptocurrencies (Bitcoin, Ethereum) and other assets (Gold, S&P 500, Nasdaq) were collected using the yfinance library.

## Preliminary Analysis

- Daily returns were calculated for Bitcoin, Ethereum, Gold, S&P 500, and Nasdaq.
- Time series plots of the daily returns were created to visualize the trends and patterns.

## Performance During the Pandemic

- Cumulative returns of Bitcoin and Gold were calculated and plotted to assess their performance.
- Findings showed that Bitcoin outperformed Gold in terms of cumulative returns during the pandemic.

## Performance During the Ukraine War

- Cumulative returns of Bitcoin and Gold were calculated and plotted to analyze their performance during the war.

## Correlation and Regression Analysis

- Correlation matrices were constructed to explore the relationships between the returns of Bitcoin, Gold, and other cryptocurrencies.

## Risk-Adjusted Performance

- The Sharpe Ratio was calculated to assess the risk-adjusted performance of Bitcoin and Gold during different periods.
- Findings indicated that Bitcoin had a higher Sharpe Ratio, suggesting better risk-adjusted performance compared to Gold.


## Conclusion

Based on the analysis, the findings indicate that Bitcoin has shown strong performance during periods of crisis, such as the COVID-19 pandemic and the Ukraine War. It has outperformed Gold in terms of cumulative returns and demonstrated better risk-adjusted performance as measured by the Sharpe Ratio.
